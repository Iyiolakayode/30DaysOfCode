According to parental testimony the birth of Babalola was preceded by unusual<br> and unexplainanble incidents the same trial that would heavily characterize his entire life.<br><br> On January 18<sup>th</sup>1918, the very year of the terrible influenza epidemic Babalola left Odo-owa<br> for Lagos with his uncle Mr.Moses Rotimi a catechist of the Anglican Church then working at<br>Oto near Badagry. He was already 14years old and yet without any education whatsoever.<br><br> This was the main reason for his leaving home. For reasons that are situated in history<br>virtually all the education programme and schools were under the mission and voluntary agency<br> until the first decade of the twentieth century. He first began his education in Aworiland where his brother was stationed for a period before, on the transfer of his uncle, he moved to Lagos.<br><br> He was again enrolled at Methodist school Ago-Ajaye at Ebutee-Metta in 1921 where he ought to<br> complete two sessions before withdrawing again in 1924. They moved to Osogbo that same year and after a period he was again enrolled at M.C.S school in the town. It was there he stayed to read up to Standard Five before he finally dropped out to learn a trade. His first trial was to learn blacksmithing<br> which he had mastered after a short time. But on the completion of his apprenticeship he had no money to buy the equipment; hence he began to work in a Hospital trying to raise the money </p>
